Here we have 3 configs:
- base config (vue linting, typescript, javascript linting)
- only vue-html linting
- only typescript linting
- only javascript linting

Also, If you have typescript and javascript `.vue` files. You can change the extension from `.vue` to `.js.vue`. Linter will check code in these components like a javascript.
